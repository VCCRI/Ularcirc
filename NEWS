CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added a stand alone function to generate fastq files from chimeric output. This is a stand alone feature (i.e. not from within Ularcirc shiny app) which is run from R command prompt.
    o Ularcirc now compatible with STAR 2.6 chimeric output.
    o Added new metric called "FSJ support", which can be used to filter out false positives from   low count (ie. < 10) BSJ data. Can also be applied to entire data set. This should not be used for RNase R treated data sets.
    o Added Ularcirc shiny app button to generate PCA plot once groups are defined.
    o Can now read in geneReads count matrix generated by STAR aligner.
    o Added download buttons for displayed tabled under "Gene_view" tab

BUG FIXES

    o Improved methodology in calculating RAD score.
    o Fixed error when merging BSJ counts from unstranded RNA-Seq data.
    o Fixed TwoSzabo data set which was previously corrupted
    o Changed various text on various buttons and menu screens

Removed
    - filter based on count number
    - side bar check menu boxes of unimplemented or redunant functions.
